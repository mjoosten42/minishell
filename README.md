# ðŸ–¥ Minishell

Small shell built in C for the exercise "Minishell" at Codam Coding College (42 Network)

## ðŸš€ Quick start
This project is dependent on "Readline"
[ How to install readline ]
```bash
$ git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:mjoosten42/minishell.git

$ make run
```

Now you've got a shell running. You can use all the commands that you can use in a normal shell. If you encounter any issues feel free to report them. Happy coding ðŸ‘»
